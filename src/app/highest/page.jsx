        Which is better- 18k Vs 22k Gold?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-white text-lg">

When comparing 18k and 22k gold, its essential to consider your personal preferences, as each has its advantages and characteristics.

 

18k gold contains 75% pure gold and is alloyed with other metals such as copper, silver, or zinc for durability and strength. This alloying process makes 18k gold less prone to scratches and dents, making it suitable for everyday wear jewelry. Additionally, 18k gold offers a more diverse range of colors and shades due to the variety of metals used in the alloy, allowing for unique and customized designs.        </p>
